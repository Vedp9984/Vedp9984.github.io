          One of the precious times in my life was when I went to Banaras for my JEE Advance preparation. I was one of the students who were doing very well in mock tests. Therefore, I had a lot of expectations for myself in the second attempt of JEE Main. Most of the time, I used to think that I am definitely going to score 99+ in Main based on the mock score. However, one day before the exam, at night, I was not able to sleep the whole night. I went to bed early, but my eyes were open the whole night. I tried every way to sleep, even went for a bath around 4 o'clock. I was very sad, thinking about what would happen to me in my morning shift. My roommates were sleeping, so the whole night, I could not sleep, and I went for my exam.

          I reached the center, just had some tea and water. I was bothered by my expectations. I went inside the exam hall; there was a long line for verification, standing for 30 minutes. Everything was unclear to me; I was not able to see properly from my eyes; everything was black. Then, when my turn came, the examiner sent me to my seat, I went there, and I fell asleep. The exam started, everyone began their exam, and I was in deep sleep. A girl sitting next to me tried to wake me; she called the examiner for help. She splashed some water on my face. Then I went to the restroom, came back, started my exam, and completed it. I was not fully satisfied with what I did. I came out of the exam hall, thanked the girl, and she asked me for sugarcane juice. I took that, then took an auto and came back.
          
          After 7 days, the result came again, I got 96%ile. It was very less than what everyone was expecting. I was in depression, and even my mind was not allowing me to start preparing again. Because I was working really hard but not getting results equivalent to my effort. Thanks to one of my friends, Akshat Singh, who told me to fill the special form for IIIT Hyderabad. I was not confident that I would be able to make it to IIIT Hyderabad because there were very few seats available through this mode. But I gave the exam without thinking about anything regarding results. Then I forgot about this and was preparing for the advance. When I felt demotivated, I used to go to a temple, Durgakund in Banaras. I felt better there.
          
          One day morning, a mail came that I was selected for the interview round. It was really good news. Then I started preparing for interviews, did a lot of research about it on Quora. Finally, the interview was over, and it was a really good experience. I answered every question properly. Then, after 7 days, I gave JEE Advanced and qualified. I did not secure a good rank, but I was happy with whatever I would get. I was fully confident that I am going to IIIT Hyderabad, but the branch was not sure. I went back from the exam center, in the evening, I went to the bank of the Ganga River. I cannot express the feeling of that time in words, but the air blowing near Assi Ghat was telling me that I have done a great job by not giving up.
          
          The next day, we were supposed to leave Banaras. Before that, my friends and I went for a party trip in IIT BHU. On the next day, I came back home during the travel journey. I was just thinking about what I would get after doing really hard work in the whole 12th class. I had never worked so hard before; that's why I was expecting something equivalent to my efforts. But even my 97%ile was a good score for people like me who come from such backgrounds. Qualifying for the exam was one of the great achievements. Somewhere in my mind, it was that I deserve something better than what I had got till now. When I reached home, I got a mail that the interview result was announced, and I got BTech in CSE at IIIT Hyderabad. Then I was really satisfied that I got what I deserved to be.
